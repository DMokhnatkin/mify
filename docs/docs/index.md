# Mify Intro

## Why Mify

Today developing cloud services is unnecessary overcomplicated. Before starting
to write you own project you have to:

1. Choose a framework and language.
2. Choose and setup storage, configuration, logging, metrics.
3. Write a lot of glue code to combine libraries into something working.
4. Setup local test environment
5. Write a lot of infrastructure yamls to setup deployment.

Mify is designed to remove this repetitive work from a developer and generate
everything required to just start writing own logic. With Mify these steps, that
would take you months, are implemented in simple commands of a CLI tool.
